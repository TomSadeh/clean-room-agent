# Clean Room Agent Meta-Plan

## Purpose

This document defines the top-level execution order and ownership boundaries across phases.

---

## Phase Split

1. **Phase 1: Knowledge Base + Indexer Build**
- Build deterministic indexing, all three DB schemas (curated, raw, session), parsers, dependency graph, git metadata, and query API.
- Creates the connection factory and all schema definitions. Populates curated DB via indexing; logs indexing run metadata to raw DB.
- Gate: `cra index` and data/query integrity are stable across all three DB schemas.

2. **Phase 2: Retrieval Pipeline Build**
- Build task analysis, scoring, scoping, precision extraction, budget enforcement, and `cra retrieve`.
- Gate: retrieval runs end-to-end and output is budget-compliant and actionable.

3. **Phase 3: Agent Harness Build**
- Build `cra solve`: prompting, generation, parse/apply/validate loop, and retries. `cra solve` calls retrieval internally (in-memory handoff). Baseline mode is out of scope for the active plan.
- Gate: solve path works end-to-end in pipeline mode.

---

## Hard Boundaries

- Phases 1-3 are **build phases**.
- Formal validation and benchmark claims are out of scope for the active plan.

---

## Dependency Order

Phase 1 -> Phase 2 -> Phase 3

No phase should pull validation gates from a later phase.

## Cross-Cutting: Three-Database Architecture

Three separate SQLite files with independent WAL journals, backups, and lifecycles:

- **Curated DB** (`curated.sqlite`) - the "clean room" the model reads from. Verified signals only.
- **Raw DB** (`raw.sqlite`) - append-only log of all activity. Training corpus and analysis source.
- **Session DB** (`session_<task_id>.sqlite`) - ephemeral per-task working memory. Created per run, discarded after.

### Ownership Table

| Phase | Curated DB | Raw DB | Session DB |
|-------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Phase 1 | **Creates schema + populates** (indexing) | **Creates schema** + logs index run metadata | **Defines schema only** (no per-task DB files created) |
| Phase 2 | Read-only (query API) | Append retrieval decisions | **Creates** per-task, writes retrieval state |
| Phase 3 | Never touches | Append all attempts, results, LLM outputs | Inherits from Phase 2, writes retry context, **closes** |

### Key Constraints

- Phases 2 and 3 never write to curated DB.
- Raw->curated derivation is explicitly not automated in the active plan.
- Phase 2 and Phase 3 share one session DB per task run. Phase 2 creates it, Phase 3 inherits it, Phase 3 closes it. In production, `cra solve` calls retrieval in-process — the session DB handoff is implicit (same process).
- Task IDs are generated by `cra solve` at startup (UUID4) and passed to Phase 2 retrieval.
- Connection factory: `get_connection(role, task_id=None)` is the single point of DB management.
- `cra enrich` is required before `cra solve --mode pipeline`. Phase 2 scoring depends on `file_metadata`.
- Token budgets are coordinated via a shared `BudgetConfig` created at `cra solve` startup and passed to Phase 2.
